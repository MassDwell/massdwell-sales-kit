AI field operations startup FYLD raises $41M to help build large-scale infrastructure

FYLD Ltd., a London-based artificial intelligence-powered startup that assists infrastructure and utility fieldwork operators, today announced it has raised $41 million in a Series B funding to accelerate the delivery of large-scale infrastructure projects.

The round was led by New York-based Energy Impact Partners LP, with participation from European growth equity specialist Partech through its Growth Impact Fund. FYLD said it closed out a year of global momentum with 82% year-over-year growth, though it didn't provide more specifics.

Founded in 2020, FYLD uses AI risk assessment, digital work execution and remote site visibility for management to provide a holistic idea of what's happening and where they can intervene. The company's platform addresses safety, productivity and remote visibility for infrastructure operations. It allows crews to capture the entirety of work conditions and progress using video, audio, photos and text on a mobile – with an AI engine performing the heavy lifting.

"The momentum we're seeing reflects a clear shift: Infrastructure leaders know reactive management of their frontline workforce has never worked at scale," said co-founder and Chief Executive Shelley Copsey.

"Our customers now include some of the most complex infrastructure organizations, managing 30,000 to 40,000 field workers, where operational certainty is a business necessity," Copsey added. "By applying AI to real-time field data, they're replacing hindsight decisions with predictable, first-time-right delivery. And they're keeping fieldworkers safe."

Digging into statistics, the company said that since its launch, FYLD has helped customers decrease serious workplace injuries by up to 48%.

Incidents of emergencies, such as emergency response and field operations, such as leaks and pollution events for water utilities, can be cut down quickly with real-time edge AI detection and hazard prediction, even in low-signal storm zones.

According to the company, an unnamed utility in Texas partnered with the company to detect and resolve site hazards after storms and was able to handle 67% of issues, reducing safety incidents and management travel by 36% during storm events.

The company primarily serves asset-heavy field operations in infrastructure, with a focus on a few core sectors such as utilities, energy, civil engineering such as highways and transport contracting, construction and heavy manufacturing.

FLYД said in 2025 the company expanded its footprint across the United States, adding customers including Kiewit Corp., Quanta Services Inc., Emery Sapp & Sons Inc. and Sulzer Ltd., alongside longstanding partners such as Ferrovial. These new customers adopted the platform to gain access to powerful AI-powered productivity for field operations.

The company said more than 40% of its total revenue is expected to come from the U.S. by the end of 2026.
